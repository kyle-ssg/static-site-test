Feature flags allow software\n            developers to change application behavior from outside of the application without redeploying their\n            code. This has a number of benefits including a separation of risks, ability to deliver different\n            experiences in a targeted manner, and the lower administrative burden of software release. Bullet Train\n            provides a turnkey robust feature management solution that offers high availability, scalability, and\n            audit control.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n            Because Bullet Train customers themselves have customers, language can get very confusing. In this\n            document, we refer to our customers (Companies who utilize our platform in their software) as members\n            (team members). We refer to the customers of those members to be \"users\" or \"end-users\".

If you are an end-user of one of our member's services, then you should consult their privacy\n            policy instead, as the member policy applies to the information collected instead of this policy. Bullet\n            Train collects data from our members about their user under their direction, but we do not have a direct\n            relationship with users themselves.

Other times, we get data\n            indirectly, like when we record that you visited one of our websites using technologies like cookies.
